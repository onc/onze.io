Hey! My name is Christian and I am a Ph. D. student at Ulm University.
In my research I try to make big and complex data comprehensible.

In my free time I enjoy cooking and I play table tennis in a local team.
I like to take pictures with old analog cameras, especially when traveling or hiking.
Also I just recently learned how to sail a boat.
